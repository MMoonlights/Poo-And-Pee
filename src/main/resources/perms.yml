# Use a permission node (e.g. 'pooandpee.pee') to restrict access
#
# Examples:
# pee: all                  - Everyone can use /pee
# pee: pooandpee.pee        - Only players with pooandpee.pee permission can use /pee
# poo: pooandpee.poo        - Only players with pooandpee.poo permission can use /poo
# reload: pooandpee.admin   - Only players with pooandpee.admin permission can reload the plugin
